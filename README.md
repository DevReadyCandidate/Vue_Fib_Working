Step 3 - The Fibonacci Numbers are embedded in the index.ts file

// Definition
// 
// The Fibonacci Numbers is a sequence of numbers in the following order: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... The next number 
// is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The formula for calculating these numbers is:
// 
// F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
// 
// where:
// 
// F(n) is the term number.
// F(n-1) is the previous term (n-1).
// F(n-2) is the term before that (n-2). 
// 
// By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are either 0 and 1, or 1 and 1, depending on the chosen 
// starting point of the sequence and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
// 
// Business Rule
// 
// The program should return a fibonacci sequence representing values between zero and ten.
// 
// Problem
// 
// The code returns an incorrect sequence.
// 
// Instruction
// 
// Determine why and return a proper set of Fibonacci Numbers.

 
Step 4 Phase 2 -  Ask them to to create the SPA ( Single page application to prodce the results to look better via CSS, and to put into a table with the index value on top of the result value
